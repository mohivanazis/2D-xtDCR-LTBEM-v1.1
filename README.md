# 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1
2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1 is a Fortran-based program that can be used to find numerical solutions of two-dimensional (2D) initial-boundary value problems, which are governed by a class of unsteady anisotropic-diffusion-diffusion-reaction (DCR) and unsteady anisotropic-diffusion-reaction (DR) equations of space-time dependent coefficients, by utilizing a combined Laplace Transform-Boundary Element Method (LTBEM). This program may provide valuable help for simulation of problems of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM).

The code 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1 can be run using software Force version 2.0.9p, a FORTRAN compiler and editor which is available for download from https://force.lepsch.com/p/download.html.

1. Download the Fortran compiler and editor
2. Open the Fortran code file 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1.f using the editor
3. Compile and run the Fortran code file 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1.f

The results will be stored in the output file 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1.out which can be viewed using a text editor.
The file 2D-xtDCR-LTBEM-v1.1.dat is the input file that will be read when the code is running.
